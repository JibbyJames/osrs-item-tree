OSRS Data Project
-----------------------------

Objective:

 - Using data retrieved from various sources, create a complete view of profit and xp per hour across various skills in OSRS.

Requirements: 

 - Must retrieve latest data from GE, including current price and daily trading volume.
 - Must consider time taken to smith/cook/high-alc/etc. item when determining profitability.
 - Must show GE profit plus high alch profit (when buying nature runes).
 - Must show a "Material cost" field for relevant items, determined by adding up GE prices. If raw materials have their own raw materials, e.g.: steel sword > steel bar > iron/coal ore, then calculate each "level" in seperate column.
 - Must have a skill level field, which can be filtered.
 - Must have skill associated with, to be filtered on, e.g.: "Smithing", "Crafting", "Cooking". This can inlcude something used in the process (ore for smithing) plus something which is the product of the process (steel sword for smithing).
			  
Example:

 - I want to see that a low costing item with high trading volume can be quickly crafted into a higher selling item for good profit and xp, such as gold bars crafted into gold amulets.
 
Notes:

 - Python will be primary language used.
 - Would like to use some database as well, maybe BigQuery.
 - Starting with crafting as a POC
 - Data extracting phases will likely take a while, so perhaps splitting by skill is a good idea.
 - Profit / Hour is requires knowing how many items can be created in an hour.

 - Need level requirement.
 - Need raw materials used to create item as array of item ids.
 - Each skill with have its own table to be joined to.
